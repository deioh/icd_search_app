You are Gemini CLI.

Create a complete backup of the current working Flask-based ICD Search App.

âœ… Backup should include:
- `app.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `data.db` SQLite file
- `templates/` folder (including index.html and search.html)
- `static/` folder (including all css/js assets)
- `config/settings.json` file if present
- Any `.bat` or `.py` utilities used for database imports

ðŸ“¦ Backup Format:
- Zip all contents into `backup_icd_search_app_<timestamp>.zip`
- Place backup file in `backups/` folder inside project root
- Include a manifest `.txt` listing all backed-up files and last-modified timestamps

ðŸ§  Behavior Notes:
- Skip `.pyc`, `__pycache__`, `.DS_Store`, or other temp files
- Confirm if Flask app is running before backup; skip hot files if locked
- Timestamp format: `YYYYMMDD_HHMM`

Respond with success message and manifest summary when done.
